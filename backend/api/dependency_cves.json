Attackers can exploit whitelisted modules and functions to execute arbitrary code, compromising the host system.

    "description": "Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.3.1, The write_build_scripts function in conda-build creates the temporary build script conda_build.sh with overly permissive file permissions (0o766), allowing write access to all users. Attackers with filesystem access can exploit a race condition to overwrite the script before execution, enabling arbitrary code execution under the victim's privileges. This risk is significant in shared environments, potentially leading to full system compromise. Even with non-static directory names, attackers can monitor parent directories for file creation events. The brief window between script creation (with insecure permissions) and execution allows rapid overwrites. Directory names can also be inferred via timestamps or logs, and automation enables exploitation even with semi-randomized paths by acting within milliseconds of detection. This issue has been patched in version 25.3.1. A workaround involves restricting conda_build.sh permissions from 0o766 to 0o700 (owner-only read/write/execute). Additionally, use atomic file creation (write to a temporary randomized filename and rename atomically) to minimize the race condition window.",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted ARP messages at a high rate over a period of time to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system resources, which eventually triggers a reload of the active route switch processor (RSP). If a redundant RSP is not present, the router reloads.",

    "description": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked. This allows leaking auth headers and private cookies. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.",

    "description": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows SSRF due to DNS Rebinding in requests wrapper. AutoGPT is built with a wrapper around Python's requests library, hardening the application against SSRF. The code for this wrapper can be found in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. The requested hostname of a URL which is being requested is validated, ensuring that it does not resolve to any local ipv4 or ipv6 addresses. However, this check is not sufficient, as a DNS server may initially respond with a non-blocked address, with a TTL of 0. This means that the initial resolution would appear as a non-blocked address. In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0). This resolution may be in the \"invalid range\". This type of attack is called a \"DNS Rebinding Attack\". This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.",

The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality, it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL, whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally, the library does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However, this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application, as long as their content type is text based.

Specifically, when loading a dataset from a source URL with an HTTP scheme, the filename extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header or the URL path is used to generate the final file path without proper sanitization. This flaw enables an attacker to control the file path fully by utilizing path traversal or absolute path techniques, such as '../../tmp/poc.txt' or '/tmp/poc.txt', leading to arbitrary file write. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a malicious user to execute commands on the vulnerable machine, potentially gaining access to data and model information.
